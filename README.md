# React Nanodegree project (FlashCards)

This is the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Native. The goal of this project to  make sure of understanding of React and Redux while giving you a chance to express your creativity. You’ll practice improving the predictability of your application’s state; establish strict rules for getting, listening, and updating the store; and identify what state should live inside of Redux and what state should live inside of React components.

Of course, you are free to start this project from scratch if you wish! Just be sure to use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.
